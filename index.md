# Setting and rules #

- [Sutter's Mill](sm.html) describes the setting (shot and long versions) and lists most of the homebrew or optional rules we'll be using
- [Corruption](corruption.html) describes my homebrew replacement for Use Magic

# MotW reference #

- Core mechanic
	- Roll 2d6 + the indicated rating (Cool, etc.) + "forward" or "ongoing" if you have those
	- 7-9 is a partial success; 10+ is complete success; bad things happen on 6-
- *Actual* core mechanic
	1. Describe what you're doing, and how
	2. Keeper will react
	3. React to what the Keeper just said (step 1)
- A little jargon
	- **Hold**:  An abstract resource.  The move that gives you hold will also tell you what you can do with it.  Hold generally lasts only through the current scene.  
	- **+1 forward**:  Add 1 to your next dice roll. 
	- **-1 ongoing**:  Subtract 1 from every roll you make until the situation no longer applies.  
- Advice on fights (MotW 109)
	- Don’t always go right to rolling dice for kick some ass. That move puts you in danger of harm as well as your enemy. If you can find a way to attack without putting yourself in danger, then you can inflict harm on the enemy without suffering any yourself (and without needing to
succeed on a roll).
	- Remember you can try to protect someone whenever they are
threatened with harm. Think about who needs protecting, and where everyone is in relation to each other. If you set things up right, you might even be able to save a teammate from the harm they’re going to suffer if they miss a roll.
	- Remember that you can help another hunter to give them +1 on a roll. This can sometimes be the difference between life and death, plus if you help in a fight the Keeper might say you can add the harm from your attack to the attack of the hunter you’re helping—so you can take a monster down faster.
